## About

**Comicos** is an Android application that lets users browse and explore information about comics. Built as a personal project to demonstrate modern Android development with a clean, declarative UI and a scalable architecture.

The app fetches comic data from a remote API and presents it through a smooth, Compose-driven interface — putting into practice the same patterns used in production apps.

---

## Features

- 📚 Browse a list of comics with cover art and metadata
- 🔍 View detailed information for each comic (title, description, characters, etc.)
- 🌐 Real-time data fetched from a remote comics API
- ⚡ Fast, responsive UI built entirely with Jetpack Compose
- 🧹 Code quality enforced with ktlint

---

## Tech Stack

This project uses a fully modern Android stack:

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **UI** | [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) — declarative UI toolkit |
| **Navigation** | [Compose Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation) |
| **DI** | [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) — compile-time dependency injection |
| **Networking** | Retrofit / Ktor + [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) |
| **Async** | [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) + Flow |
| **Architecture** | MVVM + Repository pattern |
| **Build** | Kotlin DSL (`build.gradle.kts`) + Version Catalog (`libs.versions.toml`) |
| **Code Quality** | [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) |

---

## Architecture

The app follows **MVVM with a clean Repository layer**, matching Google's recommended Android architecture:

```
UI Layer (Compose Screens)
        ↓
ViewModel (StateFlow / UI State)
        ↓
Repository
        ↓
Remote Data Source (API Service)
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio **Hedgehog** or newer
- JDK **17**
- Android SDK **API 24** (min) / **API 34** (target)

### API Key Setup

This app connects to a comics API. You'll need to provide your own API key.

1. Get your key from `[API provider URL]`
2. Add it to your `local.properties` file (already in `.gitignore`):

```properties
# local.properties
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

> **Never commit your API key.** The `.gitignore` already excludes `local.properties`.

### Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m68476521/comicos.git
cd comicos
```

Open in Android Studio, sync Gradle, and run on an emulator or device (API 24+).

---

## Code Quality

This project uses **ktlint** for Kotlin code style enforcement.

Run the linter manually:

```bash
./gradlew ktlintCheck      # check for violations
./gradlew ktlintFormat     # auto-fix formatting
```
